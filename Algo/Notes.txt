Eulerian Path: A path of graph G is called an Eulerian path, if it includes each edge of G exactly once

Eulerian Circuit: A circuit of a graph G is called an Eulerian circuit, if it include each edge of G exactly once.

Eulerian Graph: A graph containing an Eulerian circuit is called an Euler graph

Hamiltonian Path: A path of a graph G is called a Hamiltonian path, if it includes each vertex of G exactly once.

Hamiltonian Circuit: A circuit of a graph G is called a Hamiltonian circuit, if it includes each vertex of G exactly once, except the starting and end vertices which appear twice.

Hamiltonian Graph: A graph containing a Hamiltonian circuit is called a Hamiltonian graph.

Catalan Number: Is the smallest number of colors with which it can be colored
